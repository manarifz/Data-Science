# Project 2 Data Science : Socioeconomic Determinants of Poverty in Malaysia

## **Introduction** 

The poverty rate in Malaysia has experienced significant changes in recent years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the absolute poverty rate stood at 5.6% in 2019. However, due to the pandemicâ€™s impact, this rate increased to 8.4% in 2020 and slightly decreased to 8.2% in 2021. By 2022, the absolute poverty rate declined to 6.2%, involving an estimated 487,576 households (Dewan Ekonomi).Although there has been a reduction in poverty rates, a UNICEF study in October 2023 revealed that poverty remains prevalent among certain communities. 

For example, 41% of households in low-cost flats in Kuala Lumpur were below the poverty line. This rate is even higher among female-headed households headed by women (59%) and households led by individuals with disabilities (67%). The Malaysian government has taken proactive steps to address this issue. As of August 15, 2023, nearly 114,000 extremely poor families have received assistance through various initiatives (Jabatan Perdana Menteri). 

Additionally, the national Poverty Line Income (PLI) for 2022 was set at RM2,589, an increase from RM2,208 in 2019, reflecting the government's efforts to align the poverty threshold with the current cost of living (Dewan Ekonomi). Overall, while improvements have been made on the poverty rate in Malaysia, ongoing efforts are necessary to ensure the well-being of all segments of society, especially the vulnerable. 

One of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) is to eradicate extreme poverty globally by 2030, targeting individuals living on less than $2.15 a day.  Factors contributing to poverty in Malaysia include disparities in income distribution, limited access to quality education and healthcare, and inadequate basic amenities in certain regions. Additionally, economic vulnerabilities such as fluctuations in agricultural productivity and external economic shocks can exacerbate poverty levels. 

## **Problem Statement**

Despite significant progress in reducing poverty, Malaysia continues to face challenges in eradicating it completely, particularly among rural communities, indigenous populations, and urban poor households. While the national poverty rate has declined over the years, underlying factors such as unequal income distribution, limited access to quality education and healthcare, inadequate basic amenities, and regional disparities remain persistent. Furthermore, Malaysia's reliance on agriculture in rural areas exposes vulnerable communities to economic shocks, climate change, and fluctuations in commodity prices, further exacerbating poverty. 

Addressing these challenges is critical to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 1 of eradicating poverty in all its forms by 2030. A deeper understanding of the relationship between poverty and socioeconomic factors, such as income, expenditure, basic amenities, population growth, and agricultural development, is essential to designing effective policies to ensure equitable and sustainable poverty reduction in Malaysia.

## **Objectives** 

To study the relationship between poverty and other socioeconomic factors such as income, expenditure, basic amenities, population growth and agriculture development.
